            <h3>What is the difference between Synthetic Hair, Human Hair and Remy Human Hair?</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p><strong>Synthetic hair</strong><br />
            Beauty Works synthetic hair is manufactured to act and feel like human hair and can even be styled and
            heated up to 180c in moderation. Recognised as the best quality heat- friendly synthetic fibre, our
            synthetic hair extensions allow women to change and style the hair as desired. Synthetic hair usually lasts
            around 8-10 weeks depending on the aftercare.</p>
        <p><strong>Human Hair</strong><br />
            Beauty Works Human hair is 100% human hair and can last up to 3 months depending on aftercare. Human hair
            has the cuticles removed which means the life time of the hair extensions are shorter compared to Remy hair
            extensions. Human Hair extensions are ideal for clients who want hair extensions for a short period of time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Remy Human Hair</strong><br />
            Beauty Works Remy Human Hair is 100% Human Hair. Remy hair is specifically processed to ensure that the
            protective layer of the cuticles remain intact and are facing in the same direction from root to tip.
            Ensuring natural shine and vitality allowing the hair to behave tangle-free throughout its lifetime. Remy
            Human hair can last around 6 &ndash; 9 months depending on aftercare. <em><strong>Please note:
                </strong>Styling and Heating all of Beauty Works products can damage the condition of the hair and

    <div data-role="content">
        <p>During the summer and in hotter climates our hair is exposed to more UV light which can affect the colour of
            hair. Too much sun exposure, heat styling or pollution can cause hair to feel and look dry, damaged and

            salt and sun cream from the scalp it also acts as a deep cleanse for pollution particles, dirt and excess

    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Think of clarifying shampoos as shampoos to cut through product build-up and oils to leave your hair squeaky
            clean. There are lots of reasons why hair can look sad and lifeless, too much heat styling and even residue
            from normal shampoos and conditioners, all of which can cling to hair and scalp, making your freshly-washed
            hair seem heavy. Use a clarifying shampoo to cleanse hair monthly if you have normal hair, or weekly if you
            have greasy hair.

            These hair types are more fragile, and the effects of sulphate shampoo can strip out too much of the natural

            believe sacrificing hair is a sign of devotion. Daily pilgrimages to temples such as the Venkateswara Temple

            leaving the donor with a bob length hair style. The ponytail bundles are than sorted into length and size
            and exported to our factories where the production of hair extensions starts.
