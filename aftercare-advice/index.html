        <p>GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HAIR EXTENSIONS</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and condition your hair extensions with Beauty Works Pearl Nourishing Argan Shampoo and
                Conditioner – let the conditioner sit and soak into your hair extensions before rinsing</li>
            <li>When conditioning, avoid putting product on the root area and thoroughly rinse to avoid build-up
            </li>
            <li>Lock in moisture and ensure your hair extensions are truly nourished by applying a small amount
                of the Beauty Works Argan Serum to dry or wet hair</li>
            <li>Keep hair protected from heated appliances by using the Beauty Works Heat Protection Spray on
                both dry or wet hair extensions</li>
            <li>Nourish and revitalise dry hair extensions with the Beauty Works Pearl Nourishing Argan Oil Mask
            </li>
            <li>To restore shine and softness, gently comb through wet hair focusing on mid-lengths and the ends

        <h3>Brushing & Sleeping</h3>
        <p>TAKE THE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR EXTENSIONS</p>
        <p>Brushing</p>
        <p>The extensions are attached to your natural hair and therefore pulling them can result in pulling out
            your natural hair. Start brushing your hair from the bottom and then work your way up slowly to the
            top. Ensure you are using a professional extension brush to avoid breakage and damage to your own
            hair; The Beauty Works Boar Bristle Brushes have been designed specifically for all types of hair
            extensions.</p>
        <p>Sleeping</p>
        <p>Never go to sleep with wet hair; always make sure your extensions are completely dry to avoid
            tangling. When sleeping, braid your hair extensions which also helps to avoid tangling and prevents
            the cuticles from rubbing together. </p>

        <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES FOR YOUR HAIR EXTENSIONS</p>
        <p>When purchasing new extensions, there are a number of things to be aware of which will cause damage
            to your hair extensions if the hair is exposed to them.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Strictly <b>avoid salt water</b>; as salt is a natural dehydrator it can cause your hair to
                become extremely dry, discoloured and difficult to manage.</li>
            <li>Avoid getting your hair wet in swimming pools as the <b>chlorine</b> content in the water will
                also damage hair extensions, causing matting and discolouration.</li>
            <li>Wear a hat in the sun where possible or use a UV protection spray for your hair as <b>UV
                    rays</b> will discolour hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Be aware that <b>tongs, hair irons and heated rollers</b> <i>can</i> be used on your hair
                extensions, however it is advisable to minimise the use of heated tools where possible as they
                will cause damage to your hair extensions (and your own hair), and <b><u>never</b></u> apply
                heat to the hair over 180°C.</li>

        <h3>Lifespan</h3>
        <p>PROLONG THE LIFESPAN OF YOUR HAIR EXTENSIONS</p>
        <p>The lifespan of your hair extensions will depend on the aftercare. We don’t guarantee a definitive
            lifespan on any type of hair extensions due to them being a natural consumable product.</p>
        <p>We don’t recommend silver shampoos and toners as they can damage the cuticle which will affect the
            lifespan of your hair extensions. We also don’t recommend colour on hair extensions; any colouring
            of extensions is done entirely at your own risk.</p>
        <p>Light blonde coloured hair extensions will have a shorter life span due to the bleach content.
            Lighter shades will also require more care and less heat application to increase their lifespan.</p>
        <p>Wash your hair 2-3 times a week with Beauty Works aftercare products. Excess washing and styling will
            damage the cuticle and decrease the lifespan of your hair extensions.</p>
        <p>Take care of your hair extensions as you would your own natural hair and remember that like your
            natural hair, your extensions can be easily damaged with too much heat. Using heat on hair
            extensions will reduce their lifespan.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <h3>Application</h3>
        <p>MAKE SURE YOUR HAIR EXTENSIONS ARE FITTED CORRECTLY</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend that customers have a consultation before any permanent extensions are applied
            and that a qualified professional applies any professional hair extensions.</p>
        <p>Hair extensions need regular maintenance appointments, as your own hair will grow by approximately
            1.5 inches within three months. We recommend maintenance appointments every 4-6 weeks, depending on
            the application method.</p>
        <p>If maintenance appointments are not kept and the above aftercare advice is not followed, Beauty Works
            cannot be held responsible for any damage done to your own hair or the hair extensions.</p>
        <p><b>Be aware that not everyone is suitable for hair extensions.</b></p>

        <p>Fill up a sink basin with water. The water should be cool to lukewarm - not hot. Immerse all of the hair in
            the water. Make sure the hair fully absorbs the water. Now mix the Beauty Works Sulphate Free
            Shampoo into the water, use a palm full to cleanse a full set. Swish the hair around in the water by moving
            it from side to side. This is a method of agitating the hair without rubbing or scrubbing the hair. Take
            each weft piece by holding the top section of the hair and rinse hair with cool water until it’s fully
            cleansed. Rinse with cool water thoroughly. Cool water closes the hair cuticles on human hair. Ensure no
            residue is left in the hair. Now refill the sink basin with cool, clean water. Fill it up to a level high
            enough to cover all of your hair extensions. Place Beauty Works Conditioner into the water and repeat the
            same process as the shampoo procedure. Swish the hair back and forth in the water until each piece is

        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>There is no direct supply of nutrients from your scalp to your extensions, as there would be with your
            natural hair, therefore it is vital that you keep the hair nourished with the correct aftercare products. We
            recommend using a serum, such as the Beauty Works Argan Oil Serum on a daily basis to lock in moisture and
            shine, and regularly using a deep conditioning treatment to keep your extensions in the optimum condition.
            The over use of heated appliances can also strip the hair of moisture, resulting in the extensions looking
            and feeling dry. Using a heat protection spray will help prevent this and keep extensions looking and
            feeling healthy.

        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p><b>Chlorine</b> - Chlorine content in water will damage hair extensions, causing matting and discolouration,
            therefore it is advised to avoid underwater swimming. Blonde hair in particular can turn pink/orange and
            such damage cannot be repaired.</p>
        <p><b>UV rays</b> - UV rays can cause discolouration to your hair extensions therefore we advise wearing a hat
            in the sun to reduce exposure to strong UV rays.</p>
        <p><b>Iron</b> - The iron content in the water varies depending on where you live. In certain areas, if you wash
            your hair extensions in the shower, the iron levels may cause your hair extensions to turn pink or orange in
            tone (more apparent in light blonde extensions) so if possible, try to use bottled water to avoid this.</p>
        <p><b>Hard water</b> - You may notice that your hair extensions turn dull, dry or the colour fades when you wash
            them. This is due to the water in certain areas containing a higher level of an alkaline (known as hard
            water). If this is becoming an issue, installing a filtered shower head may be an option to prevent
            discolouration from hard water.</p>
        <p><b>Hot water</b> - This can cause colour to fade. Due to the heat of the water, the cuticles will open and
            the colour with drain out of the hair shaft. To prevent this, we advise washing your hair extensions in
            lukewarm water.</p>
        <p><b>Heat</b> - Excessive heat from styling appliances will change the colour pigment of the hair. The maximum
            temperature that can be used on hair extensions is 180 degrees, excessive heat and hair exposed to heat
            appliances can cause extensions to discolour. This is more apparent in blonde hair, such damage cannot be
            repaired.</p>
        <p>Please note that we cannot exchange or refund any extensions which have been exposed to these elements.</p>

            <h3>My hair extensions are shedding</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>If your pre-bonded extensions appear white or cloudy at the “bond”, something has been applied to the bonds
            that is high in alcohol, oil or sulphate to disintegrate the bonds. You will need to have the extension
            removed, re-tipped and re-applied.</p>
        <p>If the “bond” has been cut this can cause shedding due to the weight of the bond being altered. Each bond is
            specifically designed to hold the exact weight of hair and altering the bond can cause shedding of the
            extensions as it will break down quicker.</p>
        <p>If the extensions are shedding from a “weft”, this is usually due to excessive heat from styling appliances.
            Check the weft from one end to the other to see if it is in one particular area. If the extensions are
            breaking in the mid lengths or at the ends, this can be a result of “snapping”. Please see below.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Breakage and snapping can be confused with shedding. Breakage is a common perceived fault and occurs when
            excessive heat has been applied to the hair. Heat causes damage to the protective outer layer of the hair
            known as the “cuticle”, which is made up of several layers of scales which overlap and protect the main body
            of the hair, the cortex. Once the cuticle is damaged, the hair will start to break and snap through the
            mid-lengths and ends and such damage cannot be repaired.</p>

    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>All permanent tints, some semi-permanent tints, bleach, sliver shampoos and permanent wave lotions lift the
            hair cuticle to penetrate the hair shaft. Once treated in this way the hair has been altered and is
            therefore not as strong as it was previously. Any hair that has been treated with a colour is at risk to
            over processing due to the fact the extensions have already been coloured. Beauty Works do not guarantee any
            hair extensions which have been coloured and once coloured they cannot be returned.</p>

            incorrect aftercare. If you are not thoroughly rinsing the extensions after washing, product will build up
            and will make the hair extensions ‘sticky’ or “waxy” and feel or look “greasy” and this is what causes them
            to knot.</p>

            <h3>My hair extensions are matting</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Matting is a result of damage to the cuticle, for instance, if the hair has been damaged by heated
            appliances, the cuticles will become damaged and rub together causing matting. The use of incorrect brushes
            or not brushing and washing the hair extensions regularly enough can also lead to matting. Beauty Works hair
            extension brushes are designed to brush over an attachment method (weft, micro-ring and keratin bonds) and
            avoid snagging on the extensions. Regular brushing will keep the extensions in the best condition and
            prevent matting from occurring. All of our aftercare products have been designed specifically to work with
            hair extensions and we recommend following an aftercare routine 2-3 times a week to ensure the extensions
            are continually revitalised and nourished.</p>

        </div>

    <div data-role="content">
        <p>The ‘bunching-up’ effect that some hair extension wearers experience is a result of poor porosity. The hair
            can also look and feel dull and dry and it expands when washing, this is due generally to damaged and torn
            cuticles. Poor aftercare, incorrect brushes and excessive heat use are common factors in causing this. The
            hair will benefit from a deep conditioning treatment to help restore damaged cuticles.</p>

            <h3>My hair extensions are dreadlocking</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-role="content">
        <p>Dreadlocks do not just suddenly appear, they happen over a period of time due to neglect and poor
            maintenance. Brushing the hair extensions before shampooing and drying them straight after washing can help
            prevent this. Get into a night time routine, taking an extra 5 minutes at night to brush the hair and put it
            into a braid before sleeping.
            Regular maintenance appointments should be maintained. Depending on the application method, extensions
            should have regular checkup appointments between reapplication appointments.</p>
