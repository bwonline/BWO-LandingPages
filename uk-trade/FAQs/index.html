        <p>Think of clarifying shampoos as shampoos to cut through product build-up and oils to leave your hair squeaky

            from normal shampoos and conditioners, all of which can cling to hair and scalp, making your freshly-washed
            hair seem heavy. Use a clarifying shampoo to cleanse hair monthly if you have normal hair, or weekly if you
