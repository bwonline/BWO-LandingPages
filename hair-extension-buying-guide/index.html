                            Weft Hair Extensions are an affordable and effective way to add volume and length. They are
                            attached to your own hair with small micro beads that stay fixed in place for 6/8 weeks.
                            This fast and affordable option allows your stylist to apply hair extensions in an hour.
                            With non-damaging application methods, weft extensions can be applied with absolutely no
                            heat, no glue and no braid! Clever techniques mean that the wefts can be individually cut
                            and customised to fit your head size and even positioned to ensure you can wear your hair up
                            without any tell-tale signs of extensions. Select from Beauty Works <a
