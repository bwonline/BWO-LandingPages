                <p>To use Pay later you must be at least 18. Whilst this option is widely promoted, Pay later is subject

                <p>Klarna is unique and offers Pay later based on a number of factors such as the order value, previous
                    order history and item availability. If you are 18 or over, you can improve your chances of being
                    offered Pay later by ensuring you provide your full name and accurate address details and shipping
                    to your registered billing address. All orders are assessed individually. Just because you have had
                    Pay later before does not mean it will be offered for every order and in turn, as it is denied does
                    not mean it will be denied for all future orders.</p>
