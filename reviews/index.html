                        If you weren't hooked on this year's Love Island from the start, we're sure you are by now. But,
                        if there's one thing that's distracting us from all the flirting and fall-outs, it's Molly-Mae's
                        insanely dreamy hair. And it seems we're not alone, as last night the topic of her flawless hair
                        extensions was one of many lighting up Twitter. If you, like us, are wondering how she gets her
                        hair looking so perfect, then we have good news for you.

                    <p>
                        Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like this... Mermaid waves might look cute on some people, but
                        when you have long hair like I do, they can sometimes feel a little OTT. That being said, this
                        hairstyle was the most popular with my friends, I received a ton of unexpected compliments and
                        that convinced me to be more open-minded about the style. Beaty Works' hair wavers heats up
                        quickly and gives a long-lasting bend to the lengths. <br><br>

                        If you weren't hooked on this year's Love Island from the start, we're sure you are by now. But,
                        if there's one thing that's distracting us from all the flirting and fall-outs, it's Molly-Mae's
                        insanely dreamy hair. And it seems we're not alone, as last night the topic of her flawless hair
                        extensions was one of many lighting up Twitter. If you, like us, are wondering how she gets her
                        hair looking so perfect, then we have good news for you.

                    <h4>by <span style="color: gray;">VICTORIA JOWLETT March 14, 2019</span></h4>
                    <p>
                        Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like this... Mermaid waves might look cute on some people, but
                        when you have long hair like I do, they can sometimes feel a little OTT. That being said, this
                        hairstyle was the most popular with my friends, I received a ton of unexpected compliments and
                        that convinced me to be more open-minded about the style. Beaty Works' hair wavers heats up
                        quickly and gives a long-lasting bend to the lengths.
