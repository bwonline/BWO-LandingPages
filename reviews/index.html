                <p>This year, self-care took on a whole new meaning, with beauty purchases becoming a form of
                    self-prescribed therapy. After months of at-home testing and virtual shortlisting,

                <p>Of all the curling tools we tried, this styler gives you the most control over the temperature,
                    ranging from 80 to 220C. They heat up extremely fast, which is especially impressive considering
                    the fact that the barrel is 18.5cm long and designed to accommodate longer, thicker hair and
                    hair extensions. You’re left with glamorous, Hollywood-style curls, which last all day combined
                    with hairspray.</p>

                <p>Our testers were impressed with how quickly this sleek and elegant waver formed natural-looking
                    waves, which were silky and smooth. It handled large sections of hair with ease, creating an
                    even and consistent style over the whole head. The waves also held well all-day and created
                    volume.</p>

                <p>If you weren't hooked on this year's Love Island from the start, we're sure you are by now. But,
                    if there's one thing that's distracting us from all the flirting and fall-outs, it's Molly-Mae's
                    insanely dreamy hair. And it seems we're not alone, as last night the topic of her flawless hair
                    extensions was one of many lighting up Twitter. If you, like us, are wondering how she gets her
                    hair looking so perfect, then we have good news for you.</p>

                <h3>By VICTORIA JOWLETT March 14, 2019</h3>
                <p>Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like this... Mermaid waves might look cute on some people, but
                    when you have long hair like I do, they can sometimes feel a little OTT. That being said, this
                    hairstyle was the most popular with my friends, I received a ton of unexpected compliments and
                    that convinced me to be more open-minded about the style. Beauty Works' hair wavers heats up
                    quickly and gives a long-lasting bend to the lengths.</p>
